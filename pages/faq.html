      <h2>Which voice commands can I use to control my devices with Alexa?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Take a look at the <a
            href="https://github.com/csuermann/node-red-contrib-virtual-smart-home/tree/master/examples">example
            flows</a> which you can import from the Node-RED import menu (Import > Examples >
          node-red-contrib-virtual-smart-home).</p>
        <p>Here are some of the most often used commands:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alexa, switch on / off DEVICE-NAME</li>
          <li>Alexa, set DEVICE-NAME to X percent</li>
          <li>Alexa, set DEVICE-NAME to Warm white / Soft white / Daylight white / Cool white / Red / Crimson / Salmon /
            Orange / Gold / Yellow / Green / Turquoise / Cyan / Sky blue / Blue / Purple / Magenta / Pink / Lavender
          </li>
          <li>Alexa, open / close DEVICE-NAME</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How can I control devices in a specific room?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>You can create rooms in the Alexa app and assign your devices to them. Create a room which groups together an
          Alexa device (e.g. Echo) and some virtual lights. You can then control all those lights simply by speaking
          "Alexa, switch off the light" into the Alexa device.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why do my devices suddenly fail to connect and show up as 'offline'?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>If your device was not connected to the VSH backend for more than 30 days its certificate will be revoked.
          You can fix that by deleting the old connection, creating a new one and linking your virtual devices to the
          new one. All your devices should then get re-discovered by Alexa.</p>
        <p>Another reason could be that you are using an outdated version of VSH. Please update to the latest version
          (e.g using the Node-RED palette manager).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why do some of my devices show up as duplicates in the Alexa app?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Your duplicate devices might belong to a vsh-connection that no longer exists. You can delete them manually
          on the connection page where they probably show up with a shaded background, indicating they belong to another
          vsh-connection.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>I deleted a virtual device but Alexa keeps rediscovering it!</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>You probably deleted the device in the Alexa app instead of Node-RED. Open the connection page which lists
          all known devices and click the trash icon next to the device you want to delete.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why does VSH not work offline?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Alexa lives in the cloud. When you ask Alexa to control one of your devices, your voice is sent to Amazon
          servers for processing. Amazon's servers then try to make sense of what you said and which skill to invoke. If
          you said "Alexa, dim the kitchen light to fifty percent!", Alexa will realize that 'kitchen light' belongs to
          the VSH skill and invoke the VSH backend with a 'directive' containing the command that was understood (e.g.
          'SetBrightness'). The VSH skill backend then sends a message to your connected virtual device which triggers
          an outgoing msg object with the device state for you to make use of. This requires your VSH devices to be
          online.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What do you do with my data?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The VSH backend only stores metadata about your configured devices needed for VSH to function and your basic
          profile information provided by Amazon when you enabled the skill. Neither your Amazon password nor your voice
          prompts or your location is ever shared with VSH. We do not analzye your usage patterns and do not run
          marketing campaigns.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Where can I see what data is being sent to / received from the backend?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Activate the <code>Debug</code> option on the connection page and observe the output logged to stdout.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is there a way to persist the state of devices across restarts of Node-RED?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! The device state is stored as 'context' provided by Node-RED, which is kept in memory by default. You
          can easily change that by adding this snippet to your Node-RED's settings.js file:</p>
        <pre><code>contextStorage: {
    default: {
        module: "localfilesystem",
    },
},</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>In which way is the FREE plan limited?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>While you can use the FREE plan free of charge for as long as you want, it is currently limited to 7 virtual
          devices and doesn't support retrieving device state by Alexa, e.g. commands like "Alexa, what's the
          temperature in the living room" will fail.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Where can I manage my VSH subscription?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Click the 'manage subscription' button on the vsh-connection page in Node-RED. This option will only be shown
          when you already have purchased a subscription.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can you add feature X, please?</h2>
